# WeSplit

WeSplit is a practical iOS app built using SwiftUI, designed to help users easily split bills among friends or colleagues. It calculates the amount each person owes based on the total bill, selected tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the expense.

</div>

## Credits

This project is part of the ["100 Days of SwiftUI"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by Paul Hudson. I learned how to build this game and further develop my SwiftUI skills through the course.

## Learning Experience

Developing WeSplit enhanced my understanding of SwiftUI and its integration with the Swift programming language, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in building and testing iOS applications. In addition to following the main project instructions, I completed extra challenges provided at the end of the course where there were no instructions.
